I was teaching myself how to use Pygame, after my basic project with [TicTacTwist](https://github.com/KrishChatterjie/tic-tac-twist). This was a fun way to practice not only Pygame, but also my design skills to help with other front end stuff. 

Here's what's different from Flappy Bird:
* The bird is now a self-drawn bat, because 2020! ðŸ¦‡
* The pipes that you needed to avoid, are now again, self-drawn hoops that you need to go through.
* The floor is my poor interpretation of an infinite Golden Gate Bridge.
* Randomized backgrounds perfectly in tune with the aesthetic vibe of the game.
